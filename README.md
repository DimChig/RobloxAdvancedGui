# RobloxAdvancedGui
I created custom minimap, healthbar and inventory sorter for a game that i played called "Roblox"

About game:
- This was my first python project using computer vision
- I created these "Cheats" for game "Roblox" when i was 15 years old (10th grade)
- It took me around 1 week to make it (2-3 hours a day)
- I used python libraries: pygame, win32api, win32ui, numpy, keyboard, pyautogui
- What id does, it basically captures screenshots of my screen, analyzes pixels, finds similar images (on minimap) and draws on top of my screen using pygame window with "position always on top". This "advanced gui" really helps in game and provides me with new information
- Around 1k lines of code

Game Features:
- Custom minimap with sound alerts
- More useful custom healthbar
- Inventory auto-sorter, witch reordered all items in a way, that i was used to
- Auto-keybings for gui elements
- Map analyzer, that shows most "popular" places where players are most commonly located
- And much more!
This was a very good project for me to learn and understand how computer vision actually works
